   💰 WHOP APP MONETIZATION - HOW TO MAKE MONEY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📚 UNDERSTANDING WHOP'S APP MONETIZATION MODEL

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 HOW WHOP APPS MAKE MONEY (3 METHODS)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Whop supports 3 monetization models for apps:

1. 🆓 FREE TIER + 💎 PAID TIERS
   ─────────────────────────────
   • You create pricing tiers IN WHOP DEVELOPER PORTAL
   • Users install your app (starts on FREE plan)
   • Users upgrade to PRO/BUSINESS within Whop
   • Whop handles ALL payments and subscriptions
   • You get paid via Whop's payout system

   ✅ This is what we're using!

2. 💵 ONE-TIME PURCHASE
   ─────────────────────────────
   • User pays once to install
   • No recurring revenue
   • Less common for apps

3. 🔗 EXTERNAL BILLING (Advanced)
   ─────────────────────────────
   • You handle billing yourself
   • Use Stripe/Paddle/etc
   • More complex, not recommended


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 HOW YOUR CURRENT SETUP WORKS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CURRENT FLOW:
────────────

1. 📱 USER INSTALLS YOUR APP FROM WHOP APP STORE
   → Whop sends webhook: "app.installed"
   → Your app creates WhopInstallation record
   → Default plan: "free"

2. 👤 USER USES FREE FEATURES
   → Basic dashboard
   → Weekly email reports
   → 30-day analytics

3. 💎 USER WANTS PRO FEATURES
   → Clicks "Upgrade to Pro" button
   → Currently goes to: https://whop.com/apps/app_vDbFW0gw0f19QE
   ⚠️  THIS IS WRONG - it shows install page, not upgrade page!

4. ✅ CORRECT FLOW (What we need to fix):
   → User clicks "Upgrade to Pro"
   → Goes to: Whop's plan selection page for YOUR app
   → User selects Pro plan and pays via Whop
   → Whop charges user's card (monthly)
   → Whop sends webhook: "app.plan.updated" with new plan
   → Your app updates WhopInstallation.plan to "pro"
   → User now has access to Pro features!

5. 💰 YOU GET PAID
   → Whop takes their cut (usually 5-10%)
   → You receive payouts to your bank account
   → Whop handles all subscription management


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔧 WHAT'S CURRENTLY WRONG & HOW TO FIX IT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PROBLEM:
─────────
The "Upgrade to Pro" button points to:
  https://whop.com/apps/app_vDbFW0gw0f19QE

This shows the APP INSTALLATION page (for new installs).
But the user has ALREADY installed the app!

They need to see the UPGRADE/PRICING page instead.


SOLUTION:
─────────
Whop apps have TWO different URLs:

1. Installation URL (for NEW users):
   https://whop.com/apps/{APP_ID}
   
2. Upgrade URL (for EXISTING users):
   Option A: https://whop.com/hub/apps/{APP_ID}/plans
   Option B: Use Whop SDK to generate upgrade link
   Option C: Redirect to Whop dashboard upgrade page


RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
─────────────────────
Since users access your app FROM Whop (in iframe), the best
approach is to open Whop's native upgrade flow.

When in iframe context:
  → Redirect parent window to Whop's plan selection
  → User sees their current plan + upgrade options
  → After upgrade, Whop sends webhook with new plan
  → User returns to your app with Pro features enabled


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🛠️ SETUP STEPS IN WHOP DEVELOPER PORTAL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

To enable monetization, you MUST configure pricing in Whop:

1. 🔑 Go to Whop Developer Portal
   https://whop.com/developer/apps

2. 📱 Select your app (Analytics Dashboard)

3. 💰 Go to "Pricing" or "Plans" section

4. ➕ Add pricing tiers:

   FREE PLAN:
   ──────────
   Name: Free
   Price: $0/month
   Description: "Basic analytics and weekly reports"
   Features:
   • Dashboard with 5 key metrics
   • 30-day trend chart
   • Weekly email reports
   • Core analytics tracking

   PRO PLAN:
   ──────────
   Name: Pro
   Price: $29/month (or your choice)
   Description: "Advanced analytics with daily insights"
   Features:
   • Everything in Free
   • Daily email reports
   • Discord webhook alerts
   • Extended analytics history
   • Priority email support

   BUSINESS PLAN (Optional):
   ──────────
   Name: Business
   Price: $99/month
   Description: "Enterprise features and support"
   Features:
   • Everything in Pro
   • Custom data integrations
   • API access
   • White-label options
   • Dedicated support channel

5. 💾 Save pricing configuration

6. 🎯 Get the plan IDs from Whop
   Each plan will have an ID like: plan_xxxxx
   You'll need these to identify which plan user has


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔄 THE COMPLETE UPGRADE FLOW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Step-by-step what happens when user upgrades:

1. 👆 USER CLICKS "UPGRADE TO PRO"
   ────────────────────────────────
   Browser: User is in your app iframe
   Action: Button opens Whop's upgrade page in parent window

2. 💳 USER SEES WHOP'S PRICING PAGE
   ────────────────────────────────
   Shows: Free (current) vs Pro vs Business
   User: Clicks "Subscribe to Pro" ($29/month)
   Whop: Shows payment form

3. 💰 USER ENTERS PAYMENT INFO
   ────────────────────────────────
   Whop: Processes credit card via Stripe
   Whop: Creates subscription
   Whop: Charges $29 (and will auto-charge monthly)

4. 🔔 WHOP SENDS WEBHOOK TO YOUR APP
   ────────────────────────────────
   Event: "app.plan.updated"
   Payload: {
     company_id: "biz_xxxxx",
     plan: "pro",
     subscription_id: "sub_xxxxx"
   }

5. 🔄 YOUR APP UPDATES DATABASE
   ────────────────────────────────
   Action: Update WhopInstallation
   SQL: UPDATE WhopInstallation 
        SET plan = 'pro'
        WHERE companyId = 'biz_xxxxx'

6. ✅ USER RETURNS TO YOUR APP
   ────────────────────────────────
   Whop: Redirects user back to your app
   App: Detects plan = 'pro'
   UI: Shows "Pro" badge
   Features: Unlocks daily reports, Discord alerts

7. 💌 USER GETS PRO FEATURES
   ────────────────────────────────
   • Daily email reports now sent
   • Discord webhooks enabled
   • Settings show Pro features unlocked

8. 💸 YOU GET PAID
   ────────────────────────────────
   Whop: Collects $29 from user
   Whop: Takes 5-10% platform fee (~$2.90)
   You: Receive ~$26.10 via Whop payouts
   Frequency: Weekly or monthly payouts


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📱 PROPER UPGRADE BUTTON IMPLEMENTATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OPTION 1: Whop Hub URL (Recommended)
─────────────────────────────────────
When user is in Whop iframe context (experienceId exists):
  → Redirect to: https://whop.com/hub/company/{companyId}/apps/{appId}/plans
  → This opens Whop's native plan selection UI
  → User stays in Whop's ecosystem

OPTION 2: Direct App Plans URL
─────────────────────────────────────
  → Redirect to: https://whop.com/apps/{appId}/plans
  → Shows public pricing page
  → Works for both iframe and standalone

OPTION 3: Whop SDK (Most Flexible)
─────────────────────────────────────
  → Use Whop SDK to generate upgrade link
  → Can include referral codes, UTM params, etc.
  → Best for tracking conversions


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💡 RECOMMENDED FIX FOR YOUR APP
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Update getUpgradeUrl() function:

CURRENT CODE (Wrong):
──────────────────────
export function getUpgradeUrl(): string {
  const appId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID
  return appId ? `https://whop.com/apps/${appId}` : 'https://whop.com/apps'
}

NEW CODE (Correct):
──────────────────────
export function getUpgradeUrl(companyId?: string): string {
  const appId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID
  
  // If in Whop iframe (has companyId), use hub URL
  if (companyId && appId) {
    return `https://whop.com/hub/company/${companyId}/apps/${appId}/plans`
  }
  
  // Fallback: direct app plans URL
  return appId 
    ? `https://whop.com/apps/${appId}/plans` 
    : 'https://whop.com/apps'
}

USAGE:
──────────────────────
// In dashboard/experience pages
const upgradeUrl = getUpgradeUrl(installation.companyId)

// In upgrade button
<UpgradeButton upgradeUrl={upgradeUrl} />


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🧪 TESTING THE UPGRADE FLOW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. ✅ Configure pricing in Whop Developer Portal first!

2. 🔍 Test locally:
   → Open your app: http://localhost:3000
   → Verify plan shows "Free"
   → Click "Upgrade to Pro"
   → Should redirect to Whop plans page
   → URL should be: https://whop.com/apps/{appId}/plans

3. 🎭 Test with Whop test mode:
   → Use Whop's test credit card
   → Complete upgrade flow
   → Verify webhook received
   → Check database: plan should be "pro"

4. 💳 Test downgrade/cancellation:
   → User cancels Pro subscription
   → Whop sends webhook: plan = "free"
   → App should revert to free features

5. 🔄 Test recurring billing:
   → Wait for monthly renewal (or use test mode)
   → Whop auto-charges user
   → User stays on Pro plan


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💰 REVENUE PROJECTIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Example pricing: Free + Pro ($29/mo) + Business ($99/mo)

Scenario A: Conservative Growth
────────────────────────────────
Month 1:  10 free,  2 pro,  0 business  = $58/mo
Month 3:  30 free,  8 pro,  1 business  = $331/mo
Month 6:  50 free, 20 pro,  3 business  = $877/mo
Month 12: 100 free, 50 pro, 10 business = $2,440/mo

Scenario B: Good Product-Market Fit
────────────────────────────────
Month 3:  100 free, 30 pro,  5 business = $1,365/mo
Month 6:  300 free, 100 pro, 20 business = $4,880/mo
Month 12: 500 free, 250 pro, 50 business = $12,200/mo

Note: Whop takes ~5-10% platform fee
Your net revenue ≈ 90-95% of gross
